Simple Excel to RavenDB Importer
================================
A quick-and-dirty utility to get simple data into RavenDB. It uses LinqToExcel to read rows from Excel and write them as documents in RavenDB

I used it (n combination with [Random Data Generator](http://www.randomdatagenerator.net/) to get test data into Raven for testing.
